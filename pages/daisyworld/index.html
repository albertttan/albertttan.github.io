	<h2>Introduction and Applications</h2>
	<p>Nuclear fusion in the sun causes its core to contract and heat up slightly as its helium content increases. As the result, energy production from the sun's core increases, energy emitted at the surface of the sun increases, and the sun appears brighter. In fact, when the Sun first formed 4.6 billion years ago, it should have been about 30% less luminous than it is today. This means that if all other factors had remained constant, the early Earth should have been colder than it is today, being ice-covered prior to 2 billion years ago.</p>
	<p>However, this isn't the case. Sedimentary rock evidences prove that liquid water has existed on Earth's surface for at least the last 3.8 billion years. This apparent discrepancy is called the "faint young Sun paradox." The most likely solution is that the level of greenhouse gases in Earth's primitive atmosphere was significantly higher; as solar luminosity gradually increases, the level of greenhouse gases gradually decreases, keeping the temperature of the earth in a rough equilibrium.</p> 
	<p>Why should this have been true? What caused the change in greenhouse gas concentration? The Daisyworld is a hypothetical model to show how self-regulation and interaction between systems automatically created such long-term climate equilibrium on a planet, and how this equilibrium might eventually shatter when the external changes become too significant.</p>

A higher value means less irregular oscillations of daisy coverage during the simulation, so t A higher value also means less response of daisies to change of temperature in general, so the equilibrium will shift faster to the right and fall faster.</td>
