		<h2>What?</h2>
		<p>Daily Bulletin is a project. Of course it is.</p>
		<p>The project of <i>Daily Bulletin</i> aims to create Daily Bulletins. Daily Bulletins are bulletin boards for students and staff of YK Pao School. They are delivered by email every school day. They contain important information such as itineraries and notices, creative ideas like inspirations, and of course, more delicious parts like the menu.</p>
		<h2>When?</h2>
		<p>Daily Bulletins existed long before the Daily Bulletin project. They have, at the very least, already been present in YK Pao School Songjiang Campus since September, 2022. An abundance of intern staffs means that the school has plenty of free labor to complete tasks like creating Daily Bulletins.</p>
		<p>In September 2023, the school finds itself out of intern staff, and we find ourselves out of Daily Bulletins. Daily Bulletins are replaced by The Week Aheads, or weekly updates of news and notices from a SharePoint PowerPoint link.</p>
		<p>The Daily Bulletin project, has brought the Daily Bulletins back to the campus through our project that started since late September, 2023. It was founded and ran by Albert Tan until June 2023. Starting from June 2023, it has been taken over by Runxi Yu. </p>
		<h2>Why?</h2>
		<p>Though considered inconsequential by many, Daily Bulletins have been useful. Direct, daily delivery to email inboxes is simply too convenient for most students compared to a SharePoint PowerPoint link that takes 20 seconds to load. So we decided it would be a good idea to bring Daily Bulletins back with the Daily Bulletin project.</p>
		<h2>How?</h2>
		<p>We use capital to replace labor. Python codes generate repetitive contents on the Bulletins for us; we only have to fill the more creative parts. In short, it is semi-automatic, and it is becoming increasingly automatic.</p>
		<p>Of course, we cannot live without the help of our dear students and staff. Learn more on the <a href="attributions.html">Acknowledgements</a> page.</p>
