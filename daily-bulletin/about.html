		<h2>What is Daily Bulletin?</h2>
		<p>Daily Bulletin is project. Of course it is.</p>
		<p>The project of <i>Daily Bulletin</i> aims to create Daily Bulletins. Daily Bulletins are bulletin boards for students and staffs of YK Pao School. They are delivered by email every school day. They contain important information like itineraries and notices, creative ideas like inspirations, and of course, more delicious parts. You can explore the structures and contents in this <a href="help-general.html">Help Document</a>.</p>
		<h2>Long History Short</h2>
		<p>Daily Bulletins exist a long time before the start of the project of <i>Daily Bulletin</i>. At least, they have already been present in YK Pao School since the editor-in-chief of the project of Daily Bulletin joins the school in September, 2022. An abundance of intern staffs means that the school has plenty of cheap labor to complete petty tasks like creating Daily Bulletins. And so there were Daily Bulletins, powered by our dear intern staffs.</p>
		<p>They left after the end of the school year. In September 2023, the school finds itself out of cheap labor, and we find ourselves out of Daily Bulletins. Daily Bulletins are replaced by The Week Aheads, or weekly updates of news and notices from a PowerPoint link.</p>
		<p>We, <i>Daily Bulletin</i>, bring Daily Bulletins back to the school starting from later in September 2023. It is a gradual process with countless attempts of improvements. Learn more in the <a href="versions.html">Change Logs</a> page.</p>
		<h2>Why It's Necessary</h2>
		<p>Though considered petty by many, Daily Bulletins were indeed useful. Direct, daily deliveries to email inboxes are just too convenient for most students compared with a boring PowerPoint link that takes forever to load.</p>
		<p>Imagine: it is Thursday, there are two minutes to Tutor Time, and you forget where you should go. You have to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Take out your computer (5s);</li>
			<li>Click and wait for Outlook to start (15s);</li>
			<li>Furiously scroll past notifications from Monday to Thursday just to find the link to The Week Ahead (60s);</li>
			<li>Click on the link and wait for PowerPoint to start (30s);</li>
			<li>Wait for slides to load and appear (30s);</li>
			<li>Look for and navigate to the slide with the itineraries (10s).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Bravo! You are already tardy for 30 seconds.</p>
		<p>Daily Bulletins, however, take about 5 seconds to scroll and nearly no time to load. So we decide that it is a good idea to bring back Daily Bulletins with the project of <i>Daily Bulletin</i>.</p>
		<h2>How Did We Do It</h2>
		<p>We use capital to replace labor. Python codes generate repetitive contents on the Bulletins for us; we only have to fill the more creative parts. In short, it is semi-automatic, and it is becoming increasingly automatic.</p>
		<p>Of course, we cannot live without help from our dear students and staffs. Learn more in the <a href="attributions.html">Attributions</a> page.</p>
